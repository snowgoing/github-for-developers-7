Create an Issue to add your bio to the repo. The issue should contain each of the following: your name, 

the information about you from Issue #3, a request to add your bio, and some markdown formatting to make it all look pretty. 

This way the information is there for whoever ends up fixing the issue (spoiler alert, in this case that's going to be you).
